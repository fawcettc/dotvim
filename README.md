# Yet another .vim

This packaged vim setup is what I have been tweaking and working with
for ages, and should require minimal effort to get working on a new machine.

## "But what do I doooooooo?"

Simple:

        git clone git://github.com/fawcettc/dotvim.git ~/.vim
        cd ~/.vim
        ./setup.sh

Note that this currently will obliterate whatever you currently have in ~/.vim,
or might fail to work. I may fix this at some point.

## "Chris, what are the weird parts of this setup?"

There are a couple of strange things that will make you really angry for a bit,
and then be awesome.

 * Arrow keys are disabled in normal mode. What better time to learn hjkl than the present?
 * tab will always insert 4 spaces. What's that, you actually want a tab? Can't help you.
 * Use jk in sequence instead of hitting escape. You will love it, trust me.
